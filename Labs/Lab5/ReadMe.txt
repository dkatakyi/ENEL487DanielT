Description

This program is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) using through which a user can 
communicate with a target microcontroller board. When booted, the CLI prints 
out a welcome message which stays on the screen for a couple seconds. Afterwards 
the CLI prints out a prompt which tells the user how to control the LED's period. 
The LED's period is shown at the top of the Command-Line Interface's status window. 
The user can type in the command in the scrollable window created. If the input is malformed the CLI will print an error message. Entering blank lines will not print 
out an error message, it will merely create a new line for input. The user is able 
to use the backspace key to correct typing errors.


Commands

		where x is an integer value greater than 0
